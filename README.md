Jekyll website theme : [Github repo](https://github.com/thelehhman/texture)

# Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, 

```bash
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll server
```
Your theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! Open your browser at http://localhost:4000. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents.
